Property is not supported by Unity Editor by default, fortunately, there is a free plugin called [Property Backing Field Drawer](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18253) that supports drawing custom editor for properties. The plugin's code is extracted [here](https://github.com/minhhh/property-backing-field-drawer) for easy inclusion in your project.
