[ColoredProjectFolders](https://github.com/minhhh/ColoredProjectFolders) is a simple plugin that color some special folders in the Project View so that you can find them more easily. It is inspired by [Rainbow Folders](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/50668).

There's only 1 script `Assets/ColoredProjectFolder/Editor/ColoredProjectFolder.cs`. You can modify it to add more hard-coded folder names. You can add or modify folder icons in the same folders. This could be made into a customizable setting, but I feel the usage is the same as just modifying the script directly.
