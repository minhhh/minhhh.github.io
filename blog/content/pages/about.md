Slug: about

Hi, Iâ€™m <b>Huy Minh Ha</b>, a detail oriented software engineer passionate crafting software products that people love to use.

I have experience in 2D Game Development with Unity 5, Live Ops of social mobile games, backend development with Node.js, Express, MySQL.

I love learning new and better ways to write cleaner, more efficient and effective code. I consider life an never-ending journey of learning and collecting knowledge, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who care about the craft of coding and are willing to share their knowledge.

When I'm not coding, I like reading fantasy books and playing with my kid.
