Hi, Iâ€™m Huy Minh Ha. I write here for my own entertainment and hopefully yours. This site focuses on all things related to IT/Technology.

I used to use Windows, then I moved to Arch/Ubuntu. Using command line is cool, but at that time I didn't have a decent computer with SSD so they're both slow. Then I bought my first MacBook Pro, plugged in an SSD, and since then I have no intention to go back to Windows or Linux. When I have to use either OS I just fire up my Virtual Box machine by a single Vagrant command.

For a while, I didn't blog, first because I didn't have anything significant to blog about, and second because all the blogging platform require login, online editor and whatnot, which I found very cumbersome. Recently, I discover the rise of static blog, where you can write blog in Markdown format, which I love, hence this blog.
