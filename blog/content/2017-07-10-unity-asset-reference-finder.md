When using Unity, you often have to check which GameObject or Prefabs are using a certain image or other types of assets. There's a convenient tool for you to check which objects are using a certain asset: [AssetReferenceFinder](https://github.com/minhhh/UBootstrap.Core/blob/master/Assets/UBootstrap.Core/Plugins/EditorExtension/Editor/AssetReferencerFinder.cs)

Another tool called [MissingScriptFinder](https://github.com/minhhh/UBootstrap.Core/blob/master/Assets/UBootstrap.Core/Plugins/EditorExtension/Editor/MissingScriptFinder.cs) helps you find missing scripts in scene due to refactoring
