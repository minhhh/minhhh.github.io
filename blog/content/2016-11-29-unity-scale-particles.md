Unity does not provide a way to scale Shuriken particle system in Editor. The process to scale each particle system manually is very inconvenient.

There are some plugins on the Asset Store which can help you with this tasks:
* [Simple Particle Scaler](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/9703)
* [Particle Scaler](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/4400)

I've also written a tool to scale Shuriken Particles in the Editor: [unity-particle-scaler](https://github.com/minhhh/unity-particle-scaler). It's very convenient and simple to use.
