One-time password is pretty common these days for any type of account that offers two-factor authentication. We can use an app to generate OTP but it would be troublesome if we lost the app or the phone. Fortunately there's a simple way to generate OTP programmatically using libraries such as Python `OneTimePass`.

First, install `OneTimePass` with `pip`:
```
pip install onetimepass
```

Then you get the secret generated from the service provider you're using. Normally it would be a time-based token, such as the ones you use for Google Authenticator.

To get time-based token you invoke it like this:
```
import onetimepass as otp

my_secret = 'MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK'
my_token = otp.get_totp(my_secret)
print my_token
```

Remember to store your secret safely.
